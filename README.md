# Simple Typing Animation For Python :D

- Just make a folder named "lib" and drag the "type.py" script in it or just leave it with your script.
- Then in your script using "import lib.type" if you used a folder named "lib" you can change the name if you want, or just use "import type" if you put it in the same folder as your script.
- Use the function "Type(Text, TypeDelay)" and set the Text to a string like "This is a test" and the Type Dleay to the dleay between a new character, or just leave it blank for defaults
